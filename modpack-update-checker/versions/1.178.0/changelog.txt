## [1.178.0](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/compare/1.177.1...1.178.0) (2023-12-22)


### Features

* add network devices that are based on smart cable ([c833645](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/commit/c8336457e5e20bf254f9658efc255b02fb4626ca))
* full device backend rework. Device crafting is now 731% more consistant and cool. Personal assembler crafting with EMI panel on the left should be much nicer to use. And the most important part, the code looks nice now ([41ed18a](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/Create-Prepare-to-Dye/commit/41ed18a90e695b7928210e875e67c30a84063de0))
